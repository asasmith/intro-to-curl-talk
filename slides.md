</v-click>

<v-click>
```bash

```
</v-click>

curl [options] [url]
```
</v-click>

layout: center

<div class="text-center">
    <h1>Example</h1>
</div>

```bash{1|3|3-4|3-5|7-8|all}
curl -o outputFile.html http://example.com

# [options]
# -o (aliases -O, -output)
# The cURL command generates an output and this specifies the filename to write the output to (outputFile.html)

# [url]
# http://example.com
```

<h1 class="text-center">The NVM install command from earlier</h1>

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
```

<p class="text-left" v-click>
    [options]
    <br>
    -o-: The -o command writes the output to a file name but when an extra - is added the output is written to standard out (stdout)
</p v-click>

<p class="text-left" v-click>
    [url]
    <br>
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh
</p v-click>

<p class="text-left" v-click>
    | (pipe operator) This is the pipe operator in shell commands.
    <br>
    It takes the output of the command on its left (in this case, the output of the curl command) and uses it as the input for the command on its right.
</p v-click>

<p class="text-left" v-click>
    bash (shell command)
    <br>
    This part of the command invokes the Bash shell to execute the input it receives from the pipe.
    Since the input is the script downloaded by curl, this effectively means the script is executed by Bash.
